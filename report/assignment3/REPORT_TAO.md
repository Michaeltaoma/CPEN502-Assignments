## Questions

### (4) The use of a neural network to replace the look-up table and approximate the Q-function has some disadvantages and advantages.

#### a) There are 3 options for the architecture of your neural network. Describe and draw all three options and state which you selected and why. (3pts)

#### b) Show (as a graph) the results of training your neural network using the contents of the LUT from Part 2. Your answer should describe how you found the hyper-parameters which worked best for you (i.e. momentum, learning rate, number of hidden neurons). Provide graphs to backup your selection process. Compute the RMS error for your best results. (5 pts)

#### c) Comment on why theoretically a neural network (or any other approach to Q-function approximation) would not necessarily need the same level of state space reduction as a look up table. (2 pts)



### (5) Hopefully you were able to train your robot to find at least one movement pattern that results in defeat of your chosen enemy tank, most of the time.

#### a) Identify two metrics and use them to measure the performance of your robot with online training. I.e. during battle. Describe how the results were obtained, particularly with regard to exploration? Your answer should provide graphs to support your results. (5 pts)

#### b) The discount factor  can be used to modify influence of future reward. Measure the performance of your robot for different values of  and plot your results. Would you expect higher or lower values to be better and why? (3 pts)

#### c) Theory question: With a look-up table, the TD learning algorithm is proven to converge â€“ i.e. will arrive at a stable set of -values for all visited states. This is not so when the -function is approximated. Explain this convergence in terms of the Bellman equation and also why when using approximation, convergence is no longer guaranteed. (3 pts)

#### d) When using a neural network for supervised learning, performance of training is typically measured by computing a total error over the training set. When using the NN for online learning of the -function in robocode this is not possible since there is no a-priori training set to work with. Suggest how you might monitor learning performance of the neural net now. (3 pts)

#### e) At each time step, the neural net in your robot performs a back propagation using a single training vector provided by the RL agent. Modify your code so that it keeps an array of the last say n training vectors and at each time step performs n back propagations. Using graphs compare the performance of your robot for different values of n. (4 pts)



### (6) Overall Conclusions

#### a) This question is open-ended and offers you an opportunity to reflect on what you have learned overall through this project. For example, what insights are you able to offer with regard to the practical issues surrounding the application of RL & BP to your problem? E.g. What could you do to improve the performance of your robot? How would you suggest convergence problems be addressed? What advice would you give when applying RL with neural network based function approximation to other practical applications? (4 pts)

#### b) Theory question: Imagine a closed-loop control system for automatically delivering anesthetic to a patient under going surgery. You intend to train the controller using the approach used in this project. Discuss any concerns with this and identify one potential variation that could alleviate those concerns. (3 pts)
