## Part 1
As for part 1, your submission should be a brief document clearly showing the graphs requested about. Please number your graphs as above and also include in your report an appendix section containing your source code.

## Part 2
a) Draw a graph of a parameter that reflects a measure of progress of learning and comment on the convergence of learning of your robot.

b) Using your robot, show a graph comparing the performance of your robot using on-policy learning vs off-policy learning.

c) Implement a version of your robot that assumes only terminal rewards and show & compare its behaviour with one having intermediate rewards.

## Part 3

This part is about exploration. While training via RL, the next move is selected randomly with probability e and greedily with probability 1-e

a) Compare training performance using different values of e including no exploration at all. Provide graphs of the measured performance of your tank vs e.
